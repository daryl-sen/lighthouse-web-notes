### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.


```
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry === true) {
    if (availableTime <= 20) {
      console.log('Pick something up and eat it in the lab.');
    } else if (availableTime > 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
      console.log('Try a place nearby');
    } else if (availableTime > 30) {
      console.log('You don\'t actually have more than 30 minutes...');
    }
  } else {
    console.log('Get back to work');
  }
};
```
